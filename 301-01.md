# Read: 01 - SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

## Shay Howe’s intro to RWD

   RWD:Responsive web design. Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

it can be broke down to:
- flexible layouts: An easy formula to help identify the proportions of a flexible layout using relative values.The formula is based around taking the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of it’s parent element. The result is the relative width of the target element.

- media queries: Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances.you can use logical operaters here.

- flexible media: One quick way to make media scalable is by using the max-width property with a value of 100%. Doing so ensures that as the viewport gets smaller any media will scale down according to its containers width.




## All About Floats
float will make the element float in the page and the others will surround it. The float element will stay inline unlike the absolute element.
assining clear will make the element **not** follow the float around it.
float might have some bugs like it cant adapt to the changes of the elements inside like imgs, which might effect the layout of the page.

## Grid 
using grid might be easier for more complex pages, and its not hard to make them flixable.
