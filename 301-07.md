## Representational state transfer
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services. REST is popular due to its simplicity and the fact that it builds upon existing systems and features of the internet's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) in order to achieve its objectives, as opposed to creating new standards, frameworks and technologies.
- REST-based interactions happen using constructs that are familiar to anyone who is accustomed to using the internet's HTTP.
- REST is also a language-independent architectural style. REST-based applications can be written using any language, be it Java, Kotlin, .NET, AngularJS or JavaScript. As long as a programming language can make web-based requests using HTTP, it is possible for that language to be used to invoke a RESTful API or web service.
- The benefit of REST using HTTP constructs also creates restrictions, however. Many of the limitations of HTTP likewise turn into shortcomings of the REST architectural style. For example, HTTP does not store state-based information between request-response cycles, which means REST-based applications must be stateless and any state management tasks must be performed by the client.





## SUPER AGENT

SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!

## Request basics

A request can be initiated by invoking the appropriate method on the `request` object, then calling `.then()` (or `.end()` or `await`) to send the request. 
; Instead of `.then()` you can call `.end()`.

DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, POST, and PUT requests can also be used, simply change the method name. the default is (deleat).

### Setting header fields
Setting header fields is simple, invoke `.set()`with a field name and value:
``` javascript
request
   .get('/search')
   .set('API-Key', 'foobar')
   .set('Accept', 'application/json')
   .then(callback);
   ```
### GET requests
The .query() method accepts objects, which when used with the GET method will form a query-string. 
```javascript
 request
   .get('/search')
   .query({ query: 'Manny' })
   .query({ range: '1..5' })
   .query({ order: 'desc' })
   .then(res => {

   });
   ```
   ### head request
   You can also use the .query() method for HEAD requests.

   ### POST / PUT requests
A typical JSON POST request might look a little like the following, where we set the Content-Type header field appropriately, and "write" some data, in this case just a JSON string.
```javascript
   request.post('/user')
    .send({ name: 'tj', pet: 'tobi' })
    .then(callback, errorCallback)
```
 ### Retrying requests
When given the .retry() method, SuperAgent will automatically retry requests, if they fail in a way that is transient or could be due to a flaky Internet connection.

### Setting Accept
In a similar fashion to the .type() method it is also possible to set the Accept header via the short hand method .accept(). Which references request.types as well allowing you to specify either the full canonicalized MIME type name as type/subtype, or the extension suffix form as "xml", "json", "png", etc.
