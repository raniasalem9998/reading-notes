## What Is Node and When Should I Use It? 
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

 Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

### testing
 create a new file `hello.js` and copy in the following code:
```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
run this in the terminal
`node hello.js`


## Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager

In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week.!

### testing 
`npm install -g jshint` --> This will install the jshint package globally on your system. 
`jshint index.js`
You should now see a number of ES6-related errors. If you want to fix them up, add `/* jshint esversion: 6 */` to the top of the `index.js` file, re-run the command and linting should pass.
\\ A linting tool helps me avoid silly mistakes when writing JavaScript.

## What Is Node.js Used For?
- can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.
- Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server:Node.js is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. since that a large number of threads can cause a system to become sluggish — and, in the worst case, for the site to go down, but Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.[link](https://youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ)
- ***Are There Any Downsides?***
The fact that Node runs in a single thread does impose some limitations. For example, blocking I/O calls should be avoided, CPU-intensive operations should be handed off to a worker thread, and errors should always be handled correctly for fear of crashing the entire process.
- You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive (and hopefully, happier). 
## What Kind of Apps Is Node.js Suited To?
Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration
