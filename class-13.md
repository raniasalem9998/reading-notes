 # Read: 13 - Local Storage
 ## WHY
 it was intreduced to:
have a lot of storage space on the client that persists beyond a page refresh
and isnâ€™t transmitted to the server.
 ## WHAT
 HTML5 storage: it is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript.
 ## HOW
 - you can use funtions without writing the code 
 - track the changes that are made
 - the function will be used anytime you spesify
