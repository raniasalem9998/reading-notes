# Read: 09 - Refactoring

## What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

##  if a function is pure :It returns the same result if given the same arguments.

- some spetial functions yses global variables that are not passed.
- reading file is not pure.

```javascript
const charactersCounter = (text) => `Character count: ${text.length}`;

function analyzeFile(filename) {
  let fileContent = open(filename);
  return charactersCounter(fileContent);
}
```
- reliability on random nubmber is not pure..
 
 ## Pure functions benefits
The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D.

## Immutability
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

```javascript
var values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var sumOfValues = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
  sumOfValues += values[i];
}

sumOfValues // 15
```
## Referential transparency :
- `const square = (n) => n * n;` This pure function will always have the same output, given the same input.
- pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

## Higher-order functions
When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either:
takes one or more functions as arguments, or
returns a function as its result

## Map:The idea of map is to transform a collection.

## reduce 
Using reduce, we can build a function to handle the amount sum and pass it as an argument to the reduce function.
```javascript
var orders = [
  { productTitle: "Product 1", amount: 10 },
  { productTitle: "Product 2", amount: 30 },
  { productTitle: "Product 3", amount: 20 },
  { productTitle: "Product 4", amount: 60 }
];

var totalAmount = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) {
  totalAmount += orders[i].amount;
}

console.log(totalAmount); // 120
// to
let shoppingCart = [
  { productTitle: "Product 1", amount: 10 },
  { productTitle: "Product 2", amount: 30 },
  { productTitle: "Product 3", amount: 20 },
  { productTitle: "Product 4", amount: 60 }
];

const sumAmount = (currentTotalAmount, order) => currentTotalAmount + order.amount;

const getTotalAmount = (shoppingCart) => shoppingCart.reduce(sumAmount, 0);

getTotalAmount(shoppingCart); // 120
```

## Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability 
didnt get anything :)
