# Read: 10 - The Call Stack and Debugging

## Call stack
A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function..

## difinitions
`LIFO:` When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.
#### 
`Temporarily store:` When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame. This stack frame is a memory location in the stack. The memory is cleared when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack.
#### 
`Manage function invocation (call):` The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame.

This is a sample of an error, the green is the overall error message, the light blue is to note if the error was properly handled, the brownish (dark yellow) is the type of error and the red is the call stack
