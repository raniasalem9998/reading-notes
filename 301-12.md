## EJS Partials

for reusable pieces of text you can use partials to make life eaasier..
including the snippet is eazy as 
`<%- include('../layout/footer') %>`
## 
>Note: The <%- %> tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’, etc…
