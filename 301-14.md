# Read: 14a - DB Normalization
Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. to min duplicate data,min data modification issues and simplify queries.
- have a table for each purpose.
- be carful when deleating rows.
- searching will be eazier.
- when inserting rows all info best be known.

## Normal forms
- `First Normal Form` – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.Tables cannot contain sub-columns in the first normal form. 
- `Second Normal Form` – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.(The table is in 1st normal form).(Once you identify a table’s purpose, then look at each of the table’s columns and ask yourself, “Does this column serve to describe what the primary key identifies?”).
- `Third Normal Form` – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key (A table is in 2nd normal form.)(It contains only columns that are non-transitively dependent on the primary key - no dependence)
